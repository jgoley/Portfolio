I enjoyed the luxury of attending the elementary school of which my father was principal. I gardened, cried when my cats died and wanted to be a teenage mutant ninja turtle.</p><p>High school exposed me to the two interests with which I have devoted much of my life: photography and coding. I developed a simple point of sale program in BASIC for an imaginary pizza joint and spent hours in the school's darkroom watching silver coalesce into an image.</p><p>Initially I chose coding as the interest I wanted to turn into a career. But, I had not matured out of the timid child I was. After a year as a computer science major I switched to studio art (photography). This degree lead to a job at the <a href="http://columbiamuseum.org">Columbia Museum of Art</a> where I began as a preparator (art handler). Somewhere between installing Renoirs, Monets and other incomprehensibly valued artwork, I started working on the museum's website. This started me back on the track I left as a college freshman. My tenure lasted about 9 years but I still have a foot in the door helping with the technical side of things of <a href="http://tours.columbiamuseum.org/">TAP into CMA</a>.</p><p>Currently I'm living in Brooklyn. After nearly 3 years of working across the East River in Manhattan at a nonprofit called <a href="http://ecohealthalliance.org">EcoHealth Alliance</a> as a Front End Developer / Designer / Photographer / Videographer, I took a remote job as interface designer &amp; developer at <a href="//greenriver.com">Green River</a>, a software development company based in Southern Vermont.</p><p>One of my goals in day-to-day life is to leave whatever I work on, contribute to, or exist in better than I found it. It's my hope that through my professional work and by more simple acts like volunteering or picking up trash on the trail, I achieve this goal.</p></article><article><h2>Other tidbits:</h2><ul><li> To satisfy my inherent urge to help my community I volunteer my time with organizations like <a href="https://www.newyorkcares.org/">NYCares</a>, <a href="http://www.added-value.org/compost/">NYC Compost Project</a> and foster animals through <a href="http://www.nycacc.org/">NYACC</a>.</li><li>To satisfy my curiosity and respect for nature I became a beekeeper which began when a 3 pound package of honeybees (10-12 thousand stinging insects) was placed in the backseat of my car.</li><li>To satisfy my inner-Muir I've done epic solo backpacking trips in Glacier NP, Rocky Mountain NP, Olympic NP, ADK, The Whites, Catskills and all over western NC.</li><li>To satisfy my love of photography I taught myself a 19th-century process called wet plate collodion. <a href="/photographer/artist.html">Here's a sampling of my photos</a></li><li>And to satisfy my other miscellaneous interests I listen to NPR religiously, play disc golf and play guitar (along with a few other instruments).</li></ul></article><script src="scripts/base.js"></script></section></body><nav class="social-nav" id="social-nav"></nav><script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script><script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script><script src="scripts/base.js"></script></html>
